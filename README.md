# timeseries_pytorch
## Introduction
This repo is a personal mini-project to learn PyTorch. Models implemented will mostly be RNN-based, to tackle a univariate, 
single-step forecasting problem. Multi-step forecasting is also supported.

The aim is to become familiar with building deep learning models using PyTorch to capture temporal correlations and 
dependencies in a dataset. Less emphasis will be placed on accurately identifying temporal trends, distributions and such, 
although a brief EDA is provided.
